                Creating your Character
              </h1>
              <p>
                To those new to playing <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, figuring out where to start when making your first character can be quite daunting with so much information to digest. However with some help, creating your first character does not have to be a hassle. This guide will go over the five main components needed to create a fully fledged out character, including your background, lineage, class, and character sheet. A recommended first step is to have an idea of what kind of character you want to play, as you will have a good idea of who you want to make before you get into it. However this is not necessary, and you can just as easily make a character up as you follow along.

                Backgrounds
              </h1>        
              <p>
                Backgrounds in <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> are what your character did before they moved on to a life of adventure, and determine what extra skills you start your journey with. Each of these backgrounds gives you a feature, two skill proficiencies, some starting equipment, and possibly a language. There are far too many backgrounds to cover in such a small guide, so I recommend visiting sites such as <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/#toc3" target="_blank">WikiDot</a>, that have all available backgrounds, and choose one that you think matches your characters backstory.

                Lineage/Race
              </h1>
              <p>
                Much like backgrounds, there are many lineages to choose from in <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>. From more common lineages such as Humans, Elves and Half-Elves, Dwarfs, Half-Orcs and Tieflings. To more exotic and monstrous lineages such as Goblins, Githyanki, Goliaths, Aarakocra and Tabaxi. Your lineage determines and grants you many things, such as features, languages, size, speed, and stat increases. Some lineages also have subraces that may grant additional features. When choosing a lineage it is important to talk to your Dungeon Master about your choice, as not all lineages will be suitable for all campaigns. Like before, websites such as <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage" target="_blank">WikiDot</a> have all available lineages for you to choose from.

                Class
              </h1>
              <p>
                Classes in <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> are arguably the most important part of character creation, being the basis for what your character can and cannot do, as well as being a large part of your character's identity. As you level up in your class you will unlock new and more powerful abilities to help you on your adventures. Alongside your class you will also gain a subclass at either level one, two, or three, depending on your class. These subclasses allow you to specialize your character even further, and also grant abilities as you level up. <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage" target="_blank">WikiDot</a> has all the available classes and subclasses, and all the things associated with them.

              <p>
                Alignment is rather simple, being the basis of how you will play your character. The alignment chart has two axes, the first regarding your morality, where you can choose to be morally good, neutral, or evil. The second axis is in regards to rules, and if your character respects them or not. Lawful characters are more likely to adhere to rules set out by governments, organizations, or themselves, while neutral characters are more willing to bend or ignore them. Chaotic characters generally speakng have little regard for rules, and will act much more independantly than lawful characters. It should also be mentioned that the alignment chart is simply a guideline for how to roleplay your character and is not set in stone, and can change over the course of a campaign and does not need to be strictly adhered to.

              <p>
                Now that you've chosen your background, lineage, class, and alignment, you practically have a fully made character, the only thing missing being the stats. There are many systems to get your six main stats, and not every Dungeon Master uses the same one, so it's best to speak with your Dungeon Master about which system they are using. One thing to know about your stats is that for every two points above or below ten, you gain either a +1 or -1 to your ability modifier. The rest of your character sheet will be you filling out the different sections with the info relating to them for example, adding your languages, speed, hit points, and skill proficiencies you have to your sheet.

                With all of this done you now have what you need to start playing in your campaign. Of course there is still lots to learn about the different rules, classes, and how to roleplay effectively, but these are things that you will learn as you play, I do hope this guide has removed some of the hassles of being new to Dungeons and Dragons, now get out there and start adventuring!
